Freedom. That is what I desire, for myself and for you.

Freedom for what though? What is it that freedom will get for us?

The freedom to be ourselves. To be who we are, to be who we want to be and are meant to be.

Freedom to discover our true-self, who we came into this world as and then to express, expand and evolve that self to it's infinite potential.
